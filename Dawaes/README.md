# Dawaes

## Description:

Project for the WE4B course: an attempt at creating a website for traveling reservations (like Trivago).
By TROMBINI Quentin and RAMOS Jules.

## Required installs:

`npm install firebase @angular/fire` for firebase

`npm install --save angular-calendar date-fns` for angular-calendar

**Unfortunately, the calendar had to be removed because it was too inconsistent to be properly integrated (issues happened because of the response time of firebase). Code for it was left as a showcase of our work.**
